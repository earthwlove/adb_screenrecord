# adb_screenrecord

I have done a few changes to the program which can improve encoding quality, performance and speed.

You can use the following arguments:
--latency / -l
--priority / -P
--i-frame-interval / -I
--capture-rate / -c
--operating-rate / -O

There are upcoming changes that will be soon added and new options as well.
